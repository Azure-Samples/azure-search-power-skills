                "text": "OpenAI just closed a historic funding round, taking in a $6.6 billion investment at a $157 billion valuation, to continue pursuing its mission to build artificial-general intelligence according to a company blog post. The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, which committed $1 billion, according to the Financial Times. It was also reported that Thrive got a special deal (not offered to other investors) that allows it to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, Reuters reported. These funds are apparently contingent on OpenAI going through with a rumored restructure as a for-profit company. The company's for-profit wing is currently overseen by a nonprofit research body, and investor profits are capped at 100x. If OpenAI doesn't restructure itself as a for-profit company within two years, Axios reported, investors can ask for their money back. Last week, Reuters reported that the company is considering becoming a public benefit corporation (like Anthropic). In a rare move, OpenAI also asked investors to avoid backing rival start-ups such as Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI, the Financial Times reported. It's worth noting that OpenAI's latest funding round just barely surpasses xAI, which raised $6 billion in May.These billions will go toward the incredibly expensive task of training AI frontier models. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said AI models that cost $1 billion to train are in development and $100 billion models are not far behind. For OpenAI, which wants to build a series of “reasoning” models, those costs are only expected to balloon — making fresh funding rounds like this one critical."
